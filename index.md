Hi!, This is my personal pages on [Github](https://github.com/kzulfazriawan). Sometimes I do the other stuff other than Programming like Music Production and other stuff.
For me technology is just a tools, we don't worship them and they're not rule us. It's something we can bend into our will but to do that it's required knowledge, and we
can get the knowledge from everywhere, everyone, and everytime. It depends to us, are we brave enough to acquire it ? but there's a cost!.

Anyway thanks for stopping by, Catch me on social media!
